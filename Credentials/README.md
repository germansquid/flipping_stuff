### Harvester
Based on the original project (Harvester_OF_SORROW){https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Hak5-OMG-Payloads/tree/master/payloads/library/credentials/Harvester_OF_SORROW} split up into three major steps for better overview when trying to understand.
Harvester_firefox is the final product changed in function, navigation and cleanup-behaviour and also modified to work on DE/FR keyboard-layouts.


#### Harvester1
Screenshots the last used passwords from Browser (Firefox)
#### Harvester2
Zips then and cleans up afterwards
#### Harvester3
Exfiltration via hidden PowerShell Mail

### Harvester_firefox
All-in-one script of the three above

#### Just for testing purposos. I dont engage in causing trouble anywhere else (TM)
